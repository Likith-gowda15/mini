# Breast_Cancer_Detection
🎯 Automated Breast Cancer Cell Detection using Deep Learning This capstone project leverages deep learning models to accurately classify breast cancer histopathological images. Trained on a publicly available dataset and deployed using Streamlit, the application offers a clean, user-friendly interface for real-time cancer prediction.

# 🧠 Breast Cancer Cell Classification using Deep Learning

A deep learning-based web application that detects breast cancer from histopathological images using a custom CNN and ResNet50 model. This project is deployed via Streamlit.
